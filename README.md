# imagination

Collection of tools for manipulating various disc image formats.

Once the project is finished, each tool should work as follows:  
`./ext2iso input.ext [output.iso]`
- Should print out result to stdout if there is no 2nd argument
- Should accept stdin in case no argumens was provided
- Should eventually support multi-threading
- Show a progress bar with percentage in the cli mode if the output file is specified
