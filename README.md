poweriso
========

Cross-platform (*nix, Mac, Win) collection of tools to convert between various disc image formats.

This project is WIP, do not rely on these tools 100%, always keep the original image file!
==========================================================================================


When finished, each tool should work as follows:<br />
`./ext2iso input.ext [output.iso]`
- Should print out result to stdout if there is no 2nd argument;
- Should accept stdin if no argumens has been provided (we <3 pipes);
- Should support multi-threading if possible;
- Show a progress bar in the cli mode if the output file is specified;
- _Include an optional GUI if compiled for windows;_

Current progress
----------------
*2iso tools:
- [x] b5i2iso
- [x] bin2iso * (needs either flags or autodetection to set the Mode, use EdcEcc.c)
- [_] c2d2iso
- [x] cdi2iso
- [~] daa2iso   (Types.h, tinf.h, tinflate.c, LzmaDec.h, LzmaDec.c)
- [_] img2iso * (make sure it reads the .ccd file)
- [_] isz2iso   (use the python script as a spec)
- [~] mdf2iso * (make sure it reads the .mds file; implement .mdx support)
- [x] nrg2iso   (see the TODO notes in the source)
- [~] pdi2iso   (add RAW16 and RAW96, improve the progress bar)
- [_] uif2iso
- [~] xbx2iso   (merge with iso2dir, since xbx is just a variation of iso)

iso2* tools:
- [_] iso2b5i
- [X] iso2bin * (EdcEcc.h, EdcEcc.c)
- [_] iso2c2d
- [_] iso2cdi
- [_] iso2daa
- [_] iso2img *
- [_] iso2isz
- [_] iso2mdf *
- [_] iso2nrg
- [_] iso2pdi
- [_] iso2uif

bonus tools:
- [_] iso2dir (get rid of xbx2iso and just make this thing extract also xbox/xbox360 images)
- [_] dir2iso

maybe:
- [_] cdi2nrg
- [_] cdi2bin

>[_] - no code yet<br />
>[~] - got the code, yet it's not working/incomplete<br />
>[X] - complete item<br />
> *  - generates/requires a 'cue sheet' file with the same basename (thus cannot be used with pipes)
